Quote Database
===

A super simple quote database.

This quote database was created with simplicity in mind. To work correctly, it requires that you have bootstrap in the /css/ and /js/ folders. It also needs a local copy of jQuery. See index.php for the correct file naming and directories. 

Also, you must put your database information in config.php
